# Filter Sparsity 

Implementation of the filter sparsity methods [Only Train Once (OTO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07467), [Network Slimming (NS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06519) and [Polarization Pruning] (https://github.com/polarizationpruning/PolarizationPruning/blob/master/NIPS2020_PolarizationPruning.pdf) for LeNet5. The performance is benchmarked using the FashionMNIST dataset.

## Acknowledgement 
The code for NS and Polarization Pruning for LeNet5 was built/adapted based on the [official implementation](https://github.com/polarizationpruning/PolarizationPruning/tree/master) of these methods.
